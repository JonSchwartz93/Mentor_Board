# Mentor Board
## Our Mission

We want to create a friendly and supportive community to connect more experienced web developrs with up-and-coming- students. The Mentor Board provides a vehicle for mentors to post available times so that students can sign-up to work on current projects, coding challenges (e.g. algorithms, data structures, etc.) and ask any questions he/she might have regarding the tech industry.
