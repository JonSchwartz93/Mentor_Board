# Mentor Board
## Our Mission

The Mentor Board creates a friendly and supportive community to connect more experienced web developrs with up-and-coming-students. This web app provides a vehicle for mentors post their availablity so that students can sign-up to work on current projects, coding challenges (e.g. algorithms, data structures, etc.) and ask any tech-related questions he/she might have.
